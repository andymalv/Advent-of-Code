# Description
This is a repo to keep all my solutions to [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) puzzles. 

The goal is to improve my coding skills and the way I approach programming problems.
As I'm just starting out, I'll bounce around the years solving the easier puzzles first,
then move on to the more difficult ones over time.

I've also considered using a different programming language each year, using this as
an oppertunity to learn a few new ones. Not sure how much I'll keep to that though.

Languages I'm considering/would like to learn:
- C
- Zig
- Nim
- Haskell
